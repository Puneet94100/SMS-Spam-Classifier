# SMS Spam Classifier

## Introduction

This project is a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. It uses a dataset of SMS messages that are labeled as either spam or not spam, and trains a machine learning model to predict whether new messages are spam or not.
## Data 

The dataset used for this project is the SMS Spam Collection dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 5,572 SMS messages, of which 747 are spam and 4,825 are not spam.

## Conclusion

In this project, we have successfully built a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. We used the SMS Spam Collection dataset to train and test the model, achieving a high accuracy score of 98% .

The model is able to identify most spam messages correctly, with a high precision score of 95% , and also correctly identifies the majority of non-spam messages, with a high recall score.

This model can be useful for various applications such as filtering spam messages in real-time, improving user experience, and reducing potential security risks.

Future work can involve experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to further improve the accuracy of the model. Additionally, exploring different datasets and languages could extend the application of this model to other contexts beyond English SMS messages.
